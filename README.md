# Cookie-Clicker-on-Arduino
This is a simple Sketch that makes it possible to play a simplified version of Cookie Clicker on an Arduino using a few buttons and an LCD I2C display

This entire project was build using the following components:
- Arduino Mega
- 4 Buttons
- LCD I2C Display
- 4 1K Resistors
- A shitton of wires
- Breadboard

Heres the Diagram of how you should build this, if you want to build it:
