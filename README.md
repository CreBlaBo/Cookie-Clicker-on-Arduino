# Cookie-Clicker-on-Arduino V1.0
This is a simple Sketch that makes it possible to play a simplified version of Cookie Clicker on an Arduino using a few buttons and an LCD I2C display

## Hardware and how to build:

This entire project was build using the following components:
- Arduino Mega
- 4 Buttons
- LCD I2C Display
- 4 1K Resistors
- A shitton of wires
- Breadboard

Heres the Diagram of how you should build this, if you want to build it:

![Circuit Diagram](https://github.com/CreBlaBo/Cookie-Clicker-on-Arduino/blob/main/How%20to%20connect.png)

Then just Upload the [Code](https://github.com/CreBlaBo/Cookie-Clicker-on-Arduino/blob/main/Cookie%20Clicker%20on%20Arduino.ino) (You need the LiquidCrystal_I2C.h library to use this Code) and youre ready to go. make sure you have used the correct pins.

(The Code isn't exactly beautiful but if you need to change Pins, you should be able to find them, so far none of them got their own Variable.)
