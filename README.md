# Cookie-Clicker-on-Arduino V1.0
This is a simple Sketch that makes it possible to play a simplified version of Cookie Clicker on an Arduino using a few buttons and an LCD I2C display

## Hardware and how to build:

This entire project was build using the following components:
- Arduino Mega
- 4 Buttons
- LCD I2C Display
- 4 1K Resistors
- A shitton of wires
- Breadboard

Heres the Diagram of how you should build this, if you want to build it:

![Circuit Diagram](https://github.com/CreBlaBo/Cookie-Clicker-on-Arduino/blob/main/How%20to%20connect.png)

Then just Upload the [Code](https://github.com/CreBlaBo/Cookie-Clicker-on-Arduino/blob/main/Cookie%20Clicker%20on%20Arduino.ino) (You need the LiquidCrystal_I2C.h library to use this Code) and youre ready to go. make sure you have used the correct pins.
(The Code isn't exactly beautiful but if you need to change Pins, you should be able to find them.)

## Controls and amazing gameplay

The controls are pretty simple, if you look at the image, the button on the left is the one you need to spam to gain cookies, the button 2nd from the left is the button with which you buy the Click-Multiplier, the 2nd button from the right is the button with which you buy Clickers which click once a second and the right button is the button with which you buy Grannys which are professionals at making cookies.

The goal of the game is to get as many cookies as possible (my highscore is 69420 Cookies).
